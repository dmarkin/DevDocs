Test common principles
1. Find your Component Contract first
2. Decide which constraints are worth testing and which aren’t
3. Prop types are not worth testing
4. Inline styles are usually not worth testing
5. The components you render and what props you give them are important to test
6. Don’t test things that are not the concern of your component


Cheat sheet that outlines the concerns of most React components:

What do I do with the props I receive?
What components do I render? What do I pass to those components?
Do I ever keep anything in state? If so, do I invalidate it when receiving new props? When do I update state?
If a user interacts with me or a child component calls a callback I passed to it, what do I do?
Does anything happen when I’m mounted? When I’m unmounted?
